I can make anything but we only ""need"" the basics.","They don't understand why anyone would want to do visualization all the time- and they absolutely cannot imagine how data viz could be a source of profit on par with frontend or backend. They also believe that data viz is not a ""real"" software engineering focus that will prepare juniors for architect and management positions.",We should have a small budget for funding research- prototyping- and preliminary user testing of experimental visualizations. A data viz team cannot improve an organization if it's constrained to giving clients what they think they want.,"Everyone- thank you for the informative and inspirational pieces describing our industry. There're an incredible number of articles- interviews- podcasts- and meta-visualizations available to anyone interested in the job. That said- please share your negative or difficult data viz career experiences as well. You can be anonymous! For many data viz practitioners the market is dismissive and ignorant (even hostile) but positivity is the constant byword of the community. Consider a struggling artist or actor; they have access to leagues better advice than ""just work harder and wait for your inevitable big break"". Our beginners do not have a clear career path and it is very easy to lose the plot.",D3,Much more,male,26 - 35,USA or Canada,white,Private sector
